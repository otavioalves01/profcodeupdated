        <h1>Daylight - David Kushner</h1>

        Telling myself I won't go there<br>
        Oh, but I know that I won't care<br>
        Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilt<br>
        This lust is a burden that we both share<br>
        Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer<br>
        Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt<br>
        <br>
        There's darkness in the distance<br>
        From the way that I've been livin'<br>
        But I know I can't resist it<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        You and I drink the poison from the same vine<br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight<br>
        From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br>
        From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        <br>
        Tellin' myself it's the last time<br>
        Can you spare any mercy that you might find<br>
        If I'm down on my knees again?<br>
        Deep down, way down, Lord, I try<br>
        Try to follow your light, but it's night time<br>
        Please, don't leave me in the end<br>
        <br>
        There's darkness in the distance<br>
        I'm beggin' for forgiveness (ooh)<br>
        But I know I might resist it, oh<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        You and I drink the poison from the same vine<br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight<br>
        From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br>
        From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        <br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        You and I drink the poison from the same vine<br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
        Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight<br>
        From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br>
        From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight<br>
        Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time<br>
